# HIT-dataset
This is a dataset of inter-shaft bearing based on the vibration signal of rotors and casings, which comes from a aero-engine test with inter-shaft bearing fault. 
Due to the large size of the dataset file, we uploaded the dataset to Google Drive with the link as: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Km1Go4ilB_bI033SBJ7eJ0uCzbqEqbgt?usp=sharing
